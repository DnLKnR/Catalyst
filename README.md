# Catalyst
Vertical-scroller game

A side project for fun.  Open to criticism.

Object of the game is to dodge the obstacles and destroy as few a possible. (Destroying these objects deducts points from your score).


Python Interpreter w/ Pygame library needed.  (I use Python 2.7 (32-bit) w/ Pygame)


Controls:

x = Next Song

m = Mute Song

c = Explosive ammo

v = Catalyst ammo

b = Regular ammo

Mouse = controls your Fighter
